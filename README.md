Fork from https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/devices/input-output

WebRTC `adapter-7.7.1.js` is copy from https://webrtchacks.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js

Get available audio, video sources and audio output devices from `mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`
        then set the source for `getUserMedia()` using a `deviceId` constraint.
